Nos complace informar de que lanzamos nuestro primer m√≥dulo. HRV.

This class allows to perform a basic Heart Rate Variability Analysis from an RR-Interval time series. It is supposed that a numpy array (n_samples, 1) with RR intervals is available, as well as beat label numpy array vector.

For complete documentation go to [documentation](https://pycardio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) or if you prefer take a look at our first [tutorial]({{site.url}}/tutorials/hrv.html).

Go Ahead!
